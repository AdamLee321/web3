    <p>We started this website to give people the great way to purchase tickets as simply as possible.
         This project has been difficult time but we are happy with our results in sucha sort period of time,
         and with more time we would definitely produce some amazing result for our customers.</p>
    <h3>Future Plans</h3>
    <p>With more time we would definitely like to add more design to the website and complete all of the functions we haven't yet completed.
        Every website has its flaws and its just takes time to improve.
